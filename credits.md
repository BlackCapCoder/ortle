Ortle was cobbled together by one person (whom you can email at the address you
get by appending `@gmail.com` to my github username), but it probably would not
have happened without the following resources.

* [xcompmgr](http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/app/xcompmgr/) by Keith Packard
and [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton) by Christopher Jeffrey, Richard
Grenville, et (possibly) al.
These two programs provided a starting place - a set of events to watch - as
well as a working reference that I could look to whenever something unexpected
or unwanted came up.

* [The Xlib Manual](http://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/), provided by Christophe
Tronche.
Xlib is huge; this made it somewhat smaller.  I only wish the extensions were
documented as well as the core.

* [The Internet](https://duckduckgo.com/)
The billion or so code snippets and tutorials helped me around several
obstacles that I could not blunder through on my own.
